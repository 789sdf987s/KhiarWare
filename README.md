# KhiarWare(Windows Version) <under developement>
## Preface 
This is project is an example of game hacking, and it's created to share the personal experiance with the other enthusiasts in this feild of software security.<br/>
This project is just for educational porpuses and i'm not responsible of any other subversive application of this.<br/>
As you know game hacking in online games is not allowed owing to annoying some other people. Normal players who want to just have fun with games and they don't want to face a demon hacker in their fun times, so game developers will response if you do somthing to annoy the other players or in other words Cheating in game by closeing your account(e.g VACation on steam platform).<br/>

If you want to run the codes above, compile them with visual studio(i used 2019 edition), and be careful, i don't garranty that you get banned or not. To be safe and run the game in insecure mode that turns off the anti-cheat when running the game, but you cant join to VAC secure servers in this mode.(search about "CS:GO insecure mode" to know how to run on this mode)<br/>

And an other thing you have to do before running the code is, replace all values in offset.h file with the updated values (other wise it would not work, becuase the addresses will be wrong).<br/>
You can find the updated values on this link : https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper
